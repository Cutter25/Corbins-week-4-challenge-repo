# Corbins-week-4-challenge-repo
Hello user, this is a repository for Corbin's week 3 challenge! I was tasked with creating a quiz application that is run through the browser. This quiz is about common javascript principles and you are able to view the high scores of previous test takers! Be carfeul! If you answer a question incorrectly, a portion of your time will be taken away! Here is a screenshot and link to the final product below!
